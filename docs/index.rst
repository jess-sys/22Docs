The purpose of this documentation is to help you during your EPITECH course.
You will find concise documentation on main topics studied at EPITECH.

Why this documentation ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since EPITECH is built on DIY-learning, you may lack of precise documentation,
especially if you missed some topics. This RTD is built to give you a support
on which you can rely with confidence.

We really encourage people who find errors in the documentation to send us an
e-mail:
